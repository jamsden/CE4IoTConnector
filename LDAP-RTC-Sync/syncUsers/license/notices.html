that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or 
by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which 
such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent 
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim 
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution 
incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent 
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License 
for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\par<br>
(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices stating that You changed the files; and\par<br>

notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; 
and\par<br>
(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute 
must include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a 
display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such 
third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.\par<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License.\par<br>

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,

Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF 
ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without 
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or 
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise 
of permissions under this License.\par<br>
8. Limitation of Liability.\par<br>
In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by 
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or 
agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for 
damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including 
but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of 
the possibility of such damages.\par<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.\par<br>
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, 
You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of 
support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or 
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.\par<br>
